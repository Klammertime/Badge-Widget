# Project Summary 

**Insignia jQuery Plugin**
 I created this project from scratch to help users show off their online learning badges, specifically from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home)and Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/).
 
 


I use the plugin on my site under my bio here: http://audreyklammer.com/about.html

I simply include this tag:

`<div class="insignia" data-codeschool="audreyklammer" data-treehouse="audreyklammer"></div>` 


## Usage Instructions

1. Download the dist file. 

2. An index.html file is provided with my username so you can see how it might look. 

3. Adjust the CSS based on the styles on your site. Include the styles.css code and jquery.insignia.js code either in the head or concatenated with your other files based on your preferred method.

4. On the page where you'd your badges to appear, include this code, replacing "yourUsername" with your Code School and Treehouse username:

`<div class="insignia" data-codeschool="yourUsername" data-treehouse="yourUsername"></div>`
