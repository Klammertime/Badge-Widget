# Project Summary 
## Insignia jQuery Plugin
 I created this project from scratch using jQuery and responsive web design to let people show off their Treehouse and CodeSchool badges on their site. 
** I use the plugin on my site under my bio here: http://audreyklammer.com/about.html by using the <div class="insignia" data-codeschool="audreyklammer" data-treehouse="audreyklammer"></div> **


## Usage Instructions

Download the dist file. I've included an index.html file with my username so you can see how it might look. Adjust the CSS based on the styles on your site.On the page you'd like to show your badges, include this code, replacing your CodeSchool and Treehouse username in place of mine:

`<div class="insignia" data-codeschool="audreyklammer" data-treehouse="audreyklammer"></div>`

in other words, replace "yourUsername" with yours:

`<div class="insignia" data-codeschool="yourUsername" data-treehouse="yourUsername"></div>`

Include the styles.css code and jquery.insignia.js code either in the head or concatenated with your other files.
